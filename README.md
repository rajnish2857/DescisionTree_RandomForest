## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

Key columns include:
- `survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `pclass`: Passenger class
- `sex`: Gender
- `age`: Age in years
- `sibsp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `fare`: Ticket fare
- `embarked`: Port of Embarkation

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

### 1. **Summary Statistics**
- Computed mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
- Checked missing values.

### 2. **Univariate Analysis**
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical features (`age`, `fare`, etc.)
- Count plots for categorical features (`sex`, `pclass`, `embarked`)

### 3. **Multivariate Analysis**
- Correlation matrix and heatmap.
- Pairplot to analyze relationships between multiple variables.
- Violin and swarm plots to explore survival patterns.

### 4. **Pattern Recognition**
- Observed survival rate trends by gender and class.
- Identified outliers and anomalies in age and fare.

### 5. **Feature Inference**
- Gender and class significantly impacted survival chances.
- First-class female passengers had the highest survival rate.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Children (younger age group) had a higher chance of survival.# data_visualization
